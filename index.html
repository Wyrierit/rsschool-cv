                <div>
                    <p>I was born in Moscow on 8th of April in Moscow. 
                    During school period I wasn't learning pretty much anything —
                    just was using computer to play videogames in hope to attend at bigger arenas (cybersport).
                    That was a kids dreams and a lie that you could be easily here. Now I understand that the
                    time spent on videogames could have been spent
                    on learning new things like Frontend development,
                     programming languages and etc.</p>
                    <p>In college we've been diving into programming languages but not so deep. It is even funnier
                        because several month after we've got a demo exam coming up where you should be writing website
                    on WordPress.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            I'm willing to learn about Frontend development;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Willing to fix mistakes made in past and do sports with learning;
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2 class="h2section">Education</h2>
                <p>
                    I'm third-year student in Chekhov college. This year, hopefully, I will be a graduate.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During period of being a student, I was trying to learn programming languages (Python) on Stepik. This was 2 years ago.
                    Remembered it again because my graduate work I've chosen is about process of creating Telegram bot. Using open sources and tutorials,
                    I created Telegram bot on Python.

                <p>As I am not even a Junior developer
                    I have no job experience. For my graduate work I made this bot:</p>

                <p>
                    I passed EF Standard English Test which showed result of 85% - it is somewhere between B1
                    Intermediate and B2 Upper Intermediate.
